Database:

    Prereqs:
        Store a list of objects
        Each set of ORed items is in a list as an object in master list (ie: ComS 230 or Math 166)
        master list contains an object/string for each AND (ie: ComS 230, Math 166, Math 167) or (ie: ComS 230 and Math 166)
        Example of list: ComS 230, Math 166 or Math 167 or Math 237 would be stored as {ComS 230, [Math 166, Math 167, Math 237]}



what's the best way to split a string by symbols and worlds
for example, I want to split a list by `,` and `;` and `or`
so, "Black; Aluminum or Steel; Thin" would basically be split into
-Black
-{Aluminum, Steel}
-Thin


~~~~Ryans Tips:~~~~
Map<String, Course> courseMap = new HashMap<>()

private List<List<String>> prereqs;

Gson gson = new Gson();
String contents = gson.toJson(courseList);

DAG - Directed Acrylic Graph
BFS - Breadth-First Search
