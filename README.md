**Degree-Planner**
---------------------
This is a work in progress still and not functional for general use yet.
Most of the backend exists, but the user interface needs alot of work still.

Core functions currently working:
- Course parsing from ISU catalog
- Map storage of courses
- Degree audit import (still beta)
- Directed acyclic graph algorithm sorting
- Sample draggable interface in preliminary form

Long term goals include adding a web frontend in JS
